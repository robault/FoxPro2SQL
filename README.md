# FoxPro2SQL

Old (2008-ish?) simple app for importing FoxPro DBF tables into MS SQL. Currently...nonfunctional. It's August 2021 and I just tried it. I found a version 8 Visual FoxPro driver (exe in root of this repo) but it obviously needs updating beyond that. It appears there may be some syntax changes with later FoxPro drivers. I don't recall what was used previously with this code but Microsoft has abandoned FoxPro. I thought I'd upload this repo for posterity. And if anyone needs the driver, at least 8.0 is availavle here.

If someone needs some code to look off of for OLE DB connections, maybe this will help? It's pretty rough like the other repos I've been adding recentrly. This is some old old code from side projects.
